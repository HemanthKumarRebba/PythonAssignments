What is an interpreter in Python?\n","- intrepreter in python is a software which is used to convert high level language(python code) to machine understandable language  \n","\n","#3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","- pre-defines keywords are reserved words in python that has specific meaning and hold a specific purpose in python\n","- These are not used as variables or identifiers\n","\n","# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","- No, They are not used as variable names\n","\n","#5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","- A Object is mutable if it allows changes to its content after it has been assigned to a variable\n","\n","#6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","- Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.\n","- Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.\n","\n","# 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","- == operator checks whether the values (content) on the left and right sides are equal.\n","- \"is\" operater checks the memory address of variables on left and right side wheather it equals or not.\n","\n","# 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","- Logical operaters are used when we have two or more conditions to return result either true or false .\n","- \"and\" and \"or\" are python operater in python\n","-  if the two conditions which are on left and right side of \"and\" operater is true it returns True else returns False\n","- if either one of the two conditions which are on left and right side of \"or\" operater is true it returns True else returns False\n","\n","#9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","- type casting means changing from one data type to another data type.\n","- there are two types of type casting\n","  - Implicit Type Casting\n","  - Explicit Type Casting\n","- Implicit Type Casting means the machine changes itself from one data type to another data type.\n","- Explicit Type Casting means the programmer has to change from one data type to another data Type using functions\n","\n","# 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","- Implicit Type Casting means the machine changes itself from one data type to another data type.\n","- Explicit Type Casting means the programmer has to change from one data type to another data Type using functions\n","\n","# 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.\n","- They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met.\n","\n","#12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","- if the condition in the \"if\" statement is not true then the pointer go to elif block.\n","\n","- if the condition in the elif statement is true it executes that elif block and doesn't check the next elif statements or else statement.\n","\n","#13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","- Both are used for repeating a block of code\n","- for loop is used when we know the termination point in advance other wise we use while loop.\n","- for loop includes intialization, condition, and updation in one line.\n","-while includes only condition in while statement line.\n","\n","#14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","- user login until correct\n","- You can’t predict how many times the user will get it wrong.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xdEabXKcUfmx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!?\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ez3VjKVomoLY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752423980651,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"hemanthkumar rebba","userId":"11263389024991523342"}},"outputId":"6847fb76-3272-4b55-a30b-7d4d354ebf72"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program that displays your name and age?\n","name = input(\"Enter your name:\")\n","age = int(input(\"Enter your age:\"))\n","print(\"Name : \" + name)\n","print(\"Age : \" + str(age))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DAvp10IUm-3j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752424097559,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9300,"user":{"displayName":"hemanthkumar rebba","userId":"11263389024991523342"}},"outputId":"830b6db9-0000-4887-9538-e6f9df683202"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter your name:Hemanth\n","Enter your age:18\n","Name : Hemanth\n","Age : 18\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library?\n","print(help(\"keywords\"))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oSH7sjNZnbV7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752424245627,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"hemanthkumar rebba","userId":"11263389024991523342"}},"outputId":"da32fa56-8a54-4399-95a1-7ad7bfa66012"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Here is a list of the Python keywords.
