It takes cls as the first parameter and is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n","\n","  - It can access or modify class-level data and can be called using either the class name or an instance.\n","\n","- A static method does not take self or cls as the first argument and is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n","\n","  - It behaves like a regular function but lives inside the class’s namespace. It does not access or modify class or instance data.\n","\n","  - It can be called using the class name or an object\n","\n","# 11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","- method overloading cannot directly acheived in python.\n","- Python uses one method and default arguments to achieve it.\n","\n","# 12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n","- when we inherit a class and we are unhappy or want to change a method implementation then we use method Overriding.\n","- method Overriding is mostly used in Inheritence Concept.\n","\n","# 13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, so it can be accessed like an attribute, without using parentheses.\n","\n","# 14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","- polymorphism is useful in situations where we want the methods to behave differently according to situations.\n","\n","# 15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","- abstract class is used to hide the information from the user as it only contains definition.\n","- The implementation for the methods that are defined in the abstract class can be provides in the subclass that inherit the abstract class.\n","\n","# 16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","- Modularity\n","- Reusability\n","- Abstraction\n","- Polymophism\n","- Encapsulation\n","- Inheritence\n","\n","# 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","- The variable that can be initialized within the class and within the methods is called instance variable.\n","- The variable that can be initialized within the class and outside the methods is calles class variable.\n","\n","# 18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","- A class inheriting more than one class is called multiple inheritence.\n","\n","# 19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n","- __str__ is used to return a user-friendly string when we print an object.\n","\n","- __repr__ is used to return a developer-friendly string, usually meant for debugging.\n","\n","- __str__ is called by print() and str(), while __repr__ is called by repr() or in the Python shell.\n","\n","# 20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","- it is used to called the constructor of the parent class.\n","\n","# 21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","- The __del__ method is called a destructor.\n","- It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n","- It is used to clean up resources, like closing files or releasing memory.\n","\n","# 22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","- @staticmethod: Defines a method that does not depend on class or instance.\n","- @classmethod: Defines a method that works with the class itself (cls), not the instance.\n","\n","# 23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","- Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a parent class method, and the method that runs is chosen at runtime based on the object’s type.\n","\n","#24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","- Method chaining in Python OOP is calling multiple methods in a single line because each method returns the same object (self).\n","\n","#25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","- In Python, the __call__ method is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"I_By15epzu6b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message.
