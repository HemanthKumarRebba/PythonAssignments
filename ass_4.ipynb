3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","-  Interpreted Language does not convert whole code into byte code and then executes which is there in compiled language.\n","- Interpreted Language converts single statement into byte code and then executes.\n","\n","# 2.What is exception handling in Python?\n","- The runTimeErrors that terminate the program Execution unexceptedly is handled in python.This process is called Exception Handling.\n","-  In Python, we use the try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.\n","\n","# 3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","- The code we want to Execute compulsory without depending on the Exeception occurance is put in finally block.\n","\n","# 4.What is logging in Python?\n","- Logging is the process of recording messages about a program’s execution, such as errors, warnings, or informational events.\n","- It helps in debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting by keeping a record of what happened and when.\n","- Python provides the built-in logging module to write logs to the console or to files.\n","\n","# 5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","-  The __del__ method is a special method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage-collected).\n","- It is typically used to release external resources such as closing files, freeing memory, or disconnecting from databases before the object is removed from memory.\n","- Python’s garbage collector decides when to call it — you do not call it manually in most cases.\n","\n","# 6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","- import → brings in the whole module; use module_name. prefix.\n","- from ... import → brings in specific items; use them directly.\n","\n","# 7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","-Use multiple except blocks after a try block, each handling a different exception type.\n","\n","# 8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","- Ensures the file is automatically closed after the block ends.\n","- Helps prevent resource leaks and makes code cleaner.\n","\n","# 9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","- Multithreading → Multiple threads share the same memory space.\n","- Multiprocessing → Multiple processes run with separate memory spaces.\n","\n","# 10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","- Provides a record of program events for debugging and monitoring.\n","- Can be configured to log messages at different levels to files or console.\n","\n","# 11.What is memory management in Python?\n","- Process of allocating and freeing memory for objects during execution.\n","- Managed automatically by Python’s memory manager and garbage collector.\n","\n","# 12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","- Write risky code inside a try block.\n","- Use except to handle errors, else for code if no error, and finally for cleanup.\n","\n","# 13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n","- Prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient use of resources.\n","- Improves program speed and stability.\n","\n","# 14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","- try → contains code that may cause an exception.\n","- except → defines how to handle the exception if it occurs.\n","\n","# 15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","- Uses reference counting to track object usage.\n","- Also uses a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects with circular references.\n","\n","# 16.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","- Uses reference counting to track object usage.\n","- Also uses a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects with circular references.\n","\n","# 17.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","- Executes only if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n","- Used for code that should run when try is successful.\n","\n","# 18.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","- DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n","\n","# 19.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","- os.fork() → Creates a new process (Unix/Linux only).\n","- multiprocessing → Cross-platform module for creating and managing processes.\n","\n","# 20.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","- Frees system resources and ensures data is written to disk.\n","- Prevents file corruption and data loss.\n","\n","# 21.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","- read() → Reads the entire file or a specified number of characters.\n","- readline() → Reads only one line from the file.\n","\n","# 22.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","- To record messages about program execution for debugging and tracking.\n","- Supports different logging levels and output formats.\n","\n","# 23.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","- Provides functions to interact with the operating system.\n","- Includes file operations like creating, deleting, and navigating directories.\n","\n","# 24.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","- Managing circular references between objects.\n","- Avoiding memory leaks from unused objects being referenced.\n","\n","# 25.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","- Use the raise keyword followed by an exception.\n","- raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n","\n","\n","# 26.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","- Improves performance in I/O-bound tasks by running threads concurrently.\n","- Allows better responsiveness in programs with long waiting times.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mQtEtnrAGgNu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n","    f.write(\"Hello,
